# KurdishSignLanguage
The Dataset for text to Kurdish Sign Language (KSL) translation. Currently, the datasets are used to make the Sorani dialect Sign-supported. We aim at updating this datasets to leverage them to be used in Kurdish (all dialects) text to Sign translation. 
The data is updated gradually.

This data is discussed in the paper entitled "Towards Kurdish Text to Sign Translatio" (to appear).
