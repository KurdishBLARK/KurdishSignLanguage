# KurdishSignLanguage
This dataset is used in translating Kurdish texts to Kurdish Sign Language (KuSL). Currently, the dataset is useful in making the texts in the Sorani dialect Sign-supported. We aim at updating this dataset to enhance it to be used in Kurdish (all dialects) text to Sign translation. 

The data is updated gradually.

This data is discussed in a paper entitled "Towards Kurdish Text to Sign Translation" (to appear at SignLang2020 (Ninth Workshop on the Representation and Processing of Sign Languages: Sign Language Resources in the Service of the Language Community, Technological Challenges and Application Perspectives) at LREC2020).
